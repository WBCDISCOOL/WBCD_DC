<h1>2018.10.9 Progress Report</h1></hr>
By doing more practice of business canvas, I earned deeper understanding of it. 
I tried to perfect the business canvas appealing to our project, which is about a music action game in checkpoints mode called Give it up!2. 
I did research to analyze key partners, cost structure, and revenue streams, 
by using source from Invictus official website and 51 job website. 
Besides, Customer segments are diverse, 
so the business canvas should be made on different classification criteria—users and advertising firms.  

Here is the link of the file for the advanced business canvas appealing to our project.
